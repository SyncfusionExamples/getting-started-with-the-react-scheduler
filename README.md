# About React Scheduler

The [React Scheduler](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-components/react-scheduler?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=react-scheduler-github-samples), a.k.a. event calendar, facilitates almost all calendar features, thus allowing users to manage their time efficiently. It features easy resource scheduling, appointments rescheduling through editor pop-ups, drag and drop, and a resizing action. It includes wide variety of view modes with unique configuration options for each view. 

## Features and Benefits

### Different view modes

The React Scheduler offers wide variety of view modes such as day, week, work week, month, agenda, month-agenda, and timeline views. It allows you to easily configure each individual view with different, view-specific options. Options also exist to display multiple days, weeks, and months by extending each view mode based on the interval count.

### Data binding

Data binds seamlessly with various [local and remote data sources](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/schedule/data-binding?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=react-scheduler-github-samples) such as: JSON, RESTful services, OData services, and WCF services.

### Event handling options

There is built-in support for better [event handling](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-components/react-scheduler/scheduler-events?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=react-scheduler-github-samples), such as easier appointment creation and editing using the default event editor or through intuitive drag-and-resize actions. Easily configurable recurring events to repeat on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis. Change the look and feel of events by customizing their default appearance and style using templates.

### Drag and drop events

Reschedule events and appointments easily by dragging them onto the required time slots. You can also see the live time updates over the dragged appointments.

### Event resizing

Easily extend a Scheduler event’s time by resizing either its start or end handlers. You can also see the live time updates over the resized appointments.

### Resource grouping

Built-in support is available for assigning resources to events as well as [scheduling resources](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-components/react-scheduler/multiple-resources?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=react-scheduler-github-samples). Group events and appointments based on resources or dates. Grouping resources by date provides a quick overview of each resource’s availability. You can also set different working days for each resource. A new compact layout for displaying resources on a mobile screen, brings clear visibility of events of each individual resource.

### Timeline scheduling

[Timeline scheduling](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-components/react-scheduler/timeline-view?utm_source=github&utm_medium=listing&utm_campaign=react-scheduler-github-samples) plays a major role in the React Scheduler, as it displays resources in rows in a hierarchical tree-like structure with expand and collapse options. Its feature-rich calendar options, compact resource scheduling, and clear event representation allows you to employ it in various real-time applications. You can also display the year, month, and week number text labels on each individual header row of timeline views with out-of-the-box templates.

### Responsive and touch-friendly

The React Scheduler (event calendar) has a highly responsive layout and a finely optimized design for desktops, touch screens, and smart phones. It works well on all mobile phones that use iOS, Android, or Windows 8 OS.

### Customizable UI

The React Scheduler inherits almost all the calendar-specific features, such as first day of the week and timescale. Also, it allows you to customize the appearance of any part of the Scheduler interface using HTML and CSS styles.

### User-friendly interactions

The modern and trendy UI design of the react Scheduler makes the user interactions simpler and more efficient. It includes quick overview of event information, smooth date navigation, view navigation and easier selection of cells and events.

### Real-time data synchronization

Real-time appointment data of Outlook and Google Calendar accurately synchronizes with our HTML5 react Scheduler. It also supports bidirectional data communication through SignalR.

### Web framework integration
